# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Status

**All four spec phases are implemented** (data + validation + FERPA-safe round-trip, the solver, the interactive board, and results write-back + printable roster), plus UX work on top:
- **Paste import** — `parsePasted()` ingests tab-delimited rows from Excel/Google Sheets (or CSV text), matching the target sheet by headers like the `.csv` path; pasting into an already-loaded workbook replaces just that one sheet. An unrecognized paste returns `match: null` and the handler explains the expected key headers.
- **Graceful import** — `rowsFromSheet()` (the choke-point for both file-open and paste) canonicalizes every row via `canonRow`: `HEADER_ALIASES` remaps headers however they're typed/labelled ("Student ID", "student_id", the app's own friendly labels like "LC Mentor", "Class Year") → canonical keys; `normalizeValues` fixes common value variants (Yes/No/true/✓→Y/N for `BOOL_COLS`, Female/Male/NB→F/M/X, md2→MD2, mon→Mon); values are trimmed and fully-blank rows dropped. `SHEET_ALIASES` does the same for sheet/tab names in `parseWorkbook` (Schedule→Blockouts, History→PBLHistory, singular/plural). Unknown columns are kept but ignored (the editor renders only `SCHEMA` columns; export normalizes).
- **Inline editor** — the sheet view renders editable text cells, Y/N **toggle switches** for `BOOL_COLS` (`Imi`/`Resident`/`CoTutorOK`), a **multi-select checklist dropdown** (`multiPickCell`) for delimited multi-value columns — **`ScheduleTag`** (a student can hold several roles; `studentRoles`/`roleLabels`/`knownRoles`; presets seed it and you can **add a new role inline** — no more one-way "Custom…" text-box trap; `customRoles` holds in-session additions, reset on load) and tutor **`Units`** (the fixed MD1–MD7 list, not free text), and **sanitized pick-lists** (`FIELD_KINDS`, scoped per sheet so identifier columns stay free text): static enums (`GENDER_OPTS`, `MAXSTU_OPTS`, `KIND_OPTS`, `UNIT_OPTS`, `DAY_OPTS`, `HOUR_OPTS`) and record refs (`refOptions` — LC Mentor → tutors by name, Conflict Person A/B → students+tutors, history refs). All show human labels; the canonical value is stored. **Add records via a guided ingest form** (`openAddForm`) — the "Add student/tutor/conflict" buttons (tab bar + under the table) open a modal (`#formModal`) with one labelled field per `SCHEMA` column (`formControl` reuses the same toggles/pick-lists/role+unit checklists); **Add** appends, **Add & new** keeps it open for fast entry; essential fields + key-uniqueness are checked before append (`SHEET_SINGULAR`/`WIDE_FIELDS`/`readFormRow`/`submitForm`). Delete-row stays inline. **Bulk multi-row edit**: a per-row select column + select-all, and when any are selected a **bulk bar** sets one column's value across all selected rows or deletes them (`selectedRows`/`bulkCol`). Edits write back into `workbook` and re-validate live. **Undo/redo** (`history`/`histPtr`, `pushHistory`/`undo`/`redo`, `Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Shift+Z`/`Ctrl+Y`) snapshots the whole workbook per committed edit; `loadWorkbook` calls `resetHistory()`; the keydown handler defers to native field undo while a text input is focused.
- **Example data loads by default** — `makeExample()` generates a deterministic ~80-student cohort (14 tutors/groups for MD2 spread across Mon–Fri with clock times, prior MD1 history, sparse conflicts, a couple of role block-outs) with enough slack to solve with 0 violations (covered by a test). The auto-load at script end is gated on `document.body` so it's skipped under the headless test. The small `TEMPLATE` is still the downloadable starter and what the data/solver tests use.
- **Solver (Phase 2)** — pure functions (no DOM): `solve(workbook, unit, weights, locks?)` → `buildIndex` / `priorData` / `groupsForUnit` → `seed` (greedy, most-constrained-first) → `optimize` (hill-climbing swaps/moves, snapshot-revert, 12 seeded restarts via `mulberry32`) → `verifyHard` scorecard. Hard rules in `staticViolation` + `memberConflict`; soft penalties in `metricsOf`/`penaltyOf` weighted by `SOFT` slider values (never hardcoded). Over-constrained input is **not fudged**: `leastBad` keeps the least-bad placement and the relaxed rule is surfaced in `result.violations`.
- **Schedule (clock-time block-outs; replaces the old AM/PM model)** — groups carry `Day`/`Start`/`End` (Mon–Fri, `HH:00`). A **`Blockouts`** sheet holds per-`Subject` weekly busy hours, where Subject is a **role** (`ScheduleTag` value like `ImiGA`/`HOMEmgr`) **or a unit** (MD1–MD7, a known course time). `buildIndex` → `idx.blocks` (Map subject→`{day,start,end}` minutes); `scheduleFits(student, group, idx)` returns false if the group's day/time overlaps any block for the student's role **or** for `idx.unit`. A group with no day/time is unconstrained. The **Schedule tab** (`renderSchedule`) is a Mon–Fri × **30-min** grid (08:00–18:00) that edits `Blockouts`: pick a subject, **drag to paint** cells, **overlay a unit's group times** (collision cells are hatched), an impact line + **Clear** button, and arrow-key navigation; `activeTab==='Blockouts'` routes there instead of the data grid. (Resolves spec open Q §7.5.)
- **Interactive board (Phase 3)** — `renderResult` recomputes hard flags + soft scores **live** from `lastResult.groups`, so manual edits update instantly. Chips are **drag-and-drop** between groups (delegated DnD on `#board`); a chip that breaks a hard rule turns red with a tooltip. **Lock** (`locked` Set, 🔒 per chip) pins students; **Re-solve (keep locked)** passes a `locks` Map to `solve()` (pinned in `seed`, never moved in `optimize`); **Unlock all** clears them. A fresh **Solve** clears locks; `loadWorkbook` resets them.
- **Write-back + roster (Phase 4)** — Export uses `exportWorkbook()`: all canonical sheets (with edits) plus, when a clean solve exists, a **`Results`** sheet (Unit/Cohort/Group/Day/Start/End/Tutor IDs+Names/Student ID+Name) and this unit's rows appended to **`PBLHistory`** (one row per tutor; re-export *replaces* the unit's prior rows, so it's idempotent). The pure split is `resultSheets(result, workbook)` (headlessly tested). Filename is `PBL_<unit>_results.xlsx` when solved, else the plain round-trip. **Print / Save PDF roster** (`printRoster`) fills a `#printRoster` div and calls `window.print()`; a `@media print` block hides everything else (offline PDF via the browser). `Results` is an output artifact — `parseWorkbook` ignores it on re-import (not in `SHEET_ORDER`).
- **Readable labels** — a display layer (`SHEET_LABELS`, `COLUMN_LABELS`, `TAG_LABELS`/`tagLabel()`, `genderLabel`) maps canonical keys to plain-English titles for rendering only; the data keeps canonical keys/values for the `.xlsx` round-trip. Don't rename data keys.
- **App shell** — two top-level tabs (`#appTabs`: **Roster** ↔ **Groups**) toggle `#view-roster` / `#view-groups` via `showView()`; a header **icon transport bar** (`.iconbtn`, inline-SVG, aria-labelled) holds example / open / paste / template / undo-redo / export, plus a **?** that opens a how-it-works dialog. Solve lives in the Groups view; `loadWorkbook` switches to Roster.
- **First-run spotlight tour** — `#tour` is a coach-marks overlay: `#tourSpot` is a transparent box positioned over each target with a `0 0 0 9999px` shadow that dims everything else, and `#tourTip` is the step popover. `TOUR` lists steps (`{sel,title,body}`) targeting visible shell elements (transport, tabbar, `#appTabs`, export, help). Auto-runs once for new users (`localStorage 'pbl.tourSeen'`, try/caught so a `file://` origin without storage just doesn't auto-show), re-runnable via **? → Take the tour** (`#helpTour`). Arrow keys / Esc navigate.
- **Roster view** — the data editor is always shown (no summary card / Hide-data toggle — per-sheet counts already live on the tabs). The **tab bar** (`.tabbar`) carries the sheet tabs on the left and, on the right sharing the underline, a `#sheetActions` cluster with the active sheet's row count + the primary **Add row** button (a second full-width Add row sits under the table); `#sheetActions` is hidden on the Schedule tab. A **class filter** (`renderRosterFilter`/`rosterFilter`, shown with 2+ cohorts) scopes the grids to one class year while preserving real row indices; sticky first column.
- **Redesign foundation** — design tokens (`--space-*`/`--radius-*`/`--e1..3`/`--motion`), `:focus-visible` rings, `prefers-reduced-motion`, `aria-live` on validation + scorecard, modal **focus trap + restore**, in-app **confirm modal** (replaces `confirm()`), and a **toast** (`toast()`) for Solve/Export. Scorecard renders as good/neutral **status cards**. See `REDESIGN.md` (review + spec; remaining: stepper rail, Export step, responsive, keyboard drag-move, jump-to-error).
- **Theme & logo** — **light mode only** (no dark `prefers-color-scheme`): a **white masthead** with a deep-green wordmark and a single green accent rule (`border-bottom`); no gold trim (by request — green is the sole accent, `--gold` is unused). The real JABSOM logo lives at `vendor/jabsom-logo.svg`, referenced relatively in `index.html` and inlined as a `data:` URI by `build.mjs`. Never a remote URL (FERPA/offline).

`PBL_Group_Builder_Spec.md` remains the authoritative source; read it before building further, and treat its open questions (spec §7) as things to confirm with the operator rather than guess. All four build phases are now in place; remaining work is polish (e.g. the friendlier guided-workflow restructure discussed with the operator, and tightening the schedule-fit model if `ImiGA`/`HOMEmgr` should bind).

## Layout

- `index.html` — the app. Loads `vendor/xlsx.full.min.js` via a relative `<script src>`. This is what GitHub Pages serves.
- `vendor/xlsx.full.min.js` — vendored SheetJS (Apache-2.0), committed. Never load SheetJS from a CDN.
- `vendor/jabsom-logo.svg` — the JABSOM logo (a PNG wrapped in SVG). Referenced relatively in `index.html`; inlined as a `data:` URI by the build.
- `build.mjs` — `node build.mjs` inlines SheetJS **and** the logo into `dist/pbl-group-builder.html`, the **single self-contained, emailable** file the spec mandates (spec §1). `dist/` is the distribution artifact. **Gotcha:** the replacements pass a *function* to `String.replace`, not a string — the minified SheetJS contains `$&`/`$'` sequences that string-form `replace` would interpret as special patterns and silently corrupt the library. Keep the function form.
- `tests/core.test.mjs` — `node tests/core.test.mjs` runs the pure data logic (validation, build, round-trip, paste parsing) headlessly by extracting the app `<script>` from `index.html` and stubbing the DOM. No browser/deps needed. It regex-matches the script block as **the last `<script>` before `</body>` with no `src` attr**, then *appends its own* `globalThis.__app = { validate, parseWorkbook, buildWorkbook, parsePasted, TEMPLATE, SCHEMA, SHEET_ORDER }` line referencing those top-level names. So: keep the app script last before `</body>`, and if you rename any of those functions/consts in `index.html`, update the export line in the test or it silently fails to load them. The app's load-time DOM wiring (`$('btn…').onclick = …`, `document.addEventListener('keydown', …)`) runs against the test's stubs, so keep wiring tolerant of them — the stub `document` only provides `getElementById`, `createElement`, and `addEventListener`; if you call another `document`/`window` method at load time, add it to the test stub.
- `.nojekyll` — so Pages serves `vendor/` (Jekyll would skip it).

### Deviation from spec
Excel **reserves the worksheet name "History"** (change-tracking), so SheetJS (and Excel) reject it. The spec's `History` sheet is stored as **`PBLHistory`** — identical columns. This is the only schema name that differs from spec §2.

## Commands

- Run/preview: open `index.html` in a browser (`start index.html`), or open the bundled `dist/pbl-group-builder.html`.
- Build single-file: `node build.mjs`
- Test: `node tests/core.test.mjs`
- After editing `index.html` or `vendor/`, re-run the build so `dist/` stays current.

## What this is

A tool for JABSOM (medical school) Problem-Based Learning group assignment. The class (~60–80 students) is split into groups of 5–6, each with one or two faculty tutors, and **reshuffled every unit MD1–MD7**. The tool assigns students to groups subject to hard rules, optimizes soft preferences, and uses accumulated history to avoid repeats across units.

## Hard architectural constraints (these are not optional)

- **Single self-contained `.html` file, runs 100% in-browser, fully offline.** The operator double-clicks it; it opens in Chrome/Edge/Safari. No server, no build step, no install, no network calls. Distribution is just emailing the file.
- **FERPA: student data must never leave the machine.** No fetch/XHR/CDN/telemetry at runtime. Any libraries (e.g. SheetJS) must be inlined into the HTML, not loaded from a CDN. This rules out a backend, hosted web app, or any cloud dependency.
- **The operator's workbook is the database.** There is no other persistence. The tool reads the master `.xlsx`/`.csv`, solves the current unit, and writes results + appended history back into a downloaded workbook that becomes the master for the next unit. Use SheetJS (inlined) for parsing/writing; support both `.xlsx` and `.csv`. **CSV is asymmetric by design:** a loaded `.csv` is a single table, so only one sheet is ingested (matched to a schema sheet by its headers); export always writes the full multi-sheet `.xlsx` (`PBL_template.xlsx` / `PBL_export.xlsx`). The real round-trip is `.xlsx`; `.csv` load is a convenience for single-sheet edits.

## Workbook schema (the data contract)

Sheets and key columns — see spec §2 for full column lists:
- **`Students`** — `StudentID` (stable key used everywhere instead of name), `Name`, `Gender`, `Imi` (Y/N), `Resident` (Y/N), `LCMentorID`, `ScheduleTag`, `Cohort` (**class year**, e.g. `2028`). **`Cohort`** is an addition beyond spec §2: `solve(wb, unit, weights, locks, cohort)` filters the **students** to one class year; **groups are not cohort-tied** — they're auto-built from the tutors assigned to the unit and reused for whichever class is solved. The Build step picks a unit (from the tutors' `Units`) and, when >1 class year is present, a class year (from `Students.Cohort`).
- **`Tutors`** — `TutorID`, `Name`, `Units` (units they cover, a multi-select MD1–MD7 checklist), `Day`/`Start`/`End` (their **default** meeting day+time, used when auto-building groups), `MaxStudents` (default 6), `CoTutorOK`. (The old AM/PM `Availability` column is gone.)
- **`TutorTimes`** — `TutorID`, `Unit`, `Day`, `Start`, `End` — **per-(tutor, unit) meeting-time overrides** (a tutor covering several units may meet at different times per unit). Round-trips but has **no editor tab** (`HIDDEN_TABS`); edited inline in the tutor's Units checklist — each checked unit shows optional Day/Start/End selects, blank = use the tutor's default. `groupsForUnit` uses the override for the solved unit if present, else the tutor's default. May be empty. Helpers: `tutorTimeOverride`/`setTutorTime`.
- **`Conflicts`** — `TypeA_ID`, `TypeB_ID`, `Kind` (`student-student` | `tutor-student`), `Reason`.
- **Groups — auto-built, not a managed sheet.** Groups are derived per unit: **one group per assigned tutor**, at that tutor's `Day`/`Start`/`End` (so block-outs apply to them). There is **no Groups editor tab and `Groups` is no longer in `SHEET_ORDER`** (so it isn't parsed from imports or written on export). `SCHEMA.Groups` (`Unit`, `GroupID`, `Day`, `Start`, `End`, `TutorIDs`) is kept only so a hand-injected/imported `workbook.Groups` array still flows through `groupsForUnit`'s **defined-path** (used by tests + as a safety net for custom multi-tutor slots); `splitIds()` parses `TutorIDs` for co-tutors.
- **`Blockouts`** — `Subject`, `Day`, `Start`, `End` — weekly busy hours per `Subject` (a role like `ImiGA`/`HOMEmgr`, or a unit MD1–MD7). Edited via the **Schedule** tab calendar, not a raw grid. May be empty.
- **`PBLHistory`** (spec calls it `History`; renamed — see Deviation above) — `Unit`, `StudentID`, `GroupID`, `TutorID` — auto-appended after each unit. This sheet **is** the repeat-avoidance engine: "no repeat tutor" scans prior `TutorID`s for a student; "avoid repeat groupmates" scans who shared a `GroupID`. Never require the operator to hand-edit it.

Ship a template workbook with these exact headers and example rows.

## Constraints the solver enforces

**Hard (a draft violating any one is invalid):** (1) tutor–student conflict, (2) student–student conflict, (3) no repeat tutor across prior units, (4) schedule fit — a group's `Day`/`Start`/`End` must not overlap a `Blockouts` row for the student's role (`ScheduleTag`) or for the unit, (5) a student's tutor is never their `LCMentorID`. (Conflicts (1)/(2) are surfaced as **advisory warnings** in the UI, not hard pass/fail — see `verifyHard`.)

**Soft (weighted penalties, minimized):** spread Imi students (≤1 per group), spread non-residents, gender balance near class ratio, avoid repeat groupmates. Weights are **adjustable UI sliders** — do not hardcode them.

When the input is over-constrained and no fully legal solution exists, **do not silently fudge it**: return the least-bad assignment and explicitly flag which hard rule was relaxed and for whom.

## Solver approach (spec §4)

Heuristic, must run in-browser in well under a second at this scale:
1. Domain reduction — per student, precompute the set of legally joinable groups.
2. Greedy seeding — place most-constrained students (fewest legal groups) first; restart on dead-end.
3. Local search — simulated annealing / hill-climbing swapping students between groups, keeping only hard-constraint-preserving moves that lower total soft penalty; many random restarts, keep best.
4. Scorecard — report every hard constraint satisfied, each soft metric scored, and any unavoidable violation surfaced with a reason.

## UI model

Auto-solve **plus** manual override. After solving, show a board (one column per group, student chips, tutor(s) at top, live scorecard). Dragging a student re-validates live: hard-rule-breaking moves turn the chip red with a tooltip explaining why; soft scores update instantly. Operator can lock students and re-solve around them. Export writes a per-unit results sheet + appended `History`, plus a printable/PDF roster.

## Build phases (spec §6)

1. Data + validation: template, in-browser parse, input validation/error reporting — prove the load→display→export round-trip first.
2. Solver: hard-constraint engine + greedy seed + local search + scorecard.
3. Interactive board: drag-drop, live re-validation, locking, soft-weight sliders, re-solve.
4. Export polish: write-back with history append, printable roster, PDF.

## Repo hygiene (this repo is PUBLIC)

- The repo is **public** under `UHMed-OME`. No student data may ever be committed; `.gitignore` excludes `*.xlsx`/`*.csv`/`/data/`.
- A version-controlled pre-commit hook in `.githooks/pre-commit` hard-blocks committing any spreadsheet/data file (`.xlsx/.xls/.csv/.numbers/.ods/.tsv`), even with `git add -f`. Only `*.template.xlsx`/`*.template.csv` (de-identified) are allowed.
- **After cloning, activate the hook:** `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (it is not auto-enabled by clone).

## Running / testing

There is no build or test tooling. To run, open the `.html` file directly in a browser (`start file.html` on Windows). When validating the solver, test against a real **de-identified** past unit to confirm it reproduces a sensible assignment — never use real student data in this repo.
