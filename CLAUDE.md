# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Status

This repository currently contains only `PBL_Group_Builder_Spec.md` — the full implementation spec. No code has been written yet. `PBL_Group_Builder_Spec.md` is the authoritative source for all architecture and behavior; read it before building, and treat its open questions (spec §7) as things to confirm with the operator rather than guess.

## What this is

A tool for JABSOM (medical school) Problem-Based Learning group assignment. The class (~60–80 students) is split into groups of 5–6, each with one or two faculty tutors, and **reshuffled every unit MD1–MD7**. The tool assigns students to groups subject to hard rules, optimizes soft preferences, and uses accumulated history to avoid repeats across units.

## Hard architectural constraints (these are not optional)

- **Single self-contained `.html` file, runs 100% in-browser, fully offline.** The operator double-clicks it; it opens in Chrome/Edge/Safari. No server, no build step, no install, no network calls. Distribution is just emailing the file.
- **FERPA: student data must never leave the machine.** No fetch/XHR/CDN/telemetry at runtime. Any libraries (e.g. SheetJS) must be inlined into the HTML, not loaded from a CDN. This rules out a backend, hosted web app, or any cloud dependency.
- **The operator's workbook is the database.** There is no other persistence. The tool reads the master `.xlsx`/`.csv`, solves the current unit, and writes results + appended history back into a downloaded workbook that becomes the master for the next unit. Use SheetJS (inlined) for parsing/writing; support both `.xlsx` and `.csv`.

## Workbook schema (the data contract)

Sheets and key columns — see spec §2 for full column lists:
- **`Students`** — `StudentID` (stable key used everywhere instead of name), `Name`, `Gender`, `Imi` (Y/N), `Resident` (Y/N), `LCMentorID`, `ScheduleTag`.
- **`Tutors`** — `TutorID`, `Name`, `Availability`, `MaxStudents` (default 6), `CoTutorOK`.
- **`Conflicts`** — `TypeA_ID`, `TypeB_ID`, `Kind` (`student-student` | `tutor-student`), `Reason`.
- **`Groups`** — `Unit`, `GroupID`, `TimeSlot`, `TutorID(s)` — defines this unit's slots.
- **`History`** — `Unit`, `StudentID`, `GroupID`, `TutorID` — auto-appended after each unit. This sheet **is** the repeat-avoidance engine: "no repeat tutor" scans prior `TutorID`s for a student; "avoid repeat groupmates" scans who shared a `GroupID`. Never require the operator to hand-edit it.

Ship a template workbook with these exact headers and example rows.

## Constraints the solver enforces

**Hard (a draft violating any one is invalid):** (1) tutor–student conflict, (2) student–student conflict, (3) no repeat tutor across prior units, (4) schedule fit via `ScheduleTag` ↔ `TimeSlot`/availability, (5) a student's tutor is never their `LCMentorID`.

**Soft (weighted penalties, minimized):** spread Imi students (≤1 per group), spread non-residents, gender balance near class ratio, avoid repeat groupmates. Weights are **adjustable UI sliders** — do not hardcode them.

When the input is over-constrained and no fully legal solution exists, **do not silently fudge it**: return the least-bad assignment and explicitly flag which hard rule was relaxed and for whom.

## Solver approach (spec §4)

Heuristic, must run in-browser in well under a second at this scale:
1. Domain reduction — per student, precompute the set of legally joinable groups.
2. Greedy seeding — place most-constrained students (fewest legal groups) first; restart on dead-end.
3. Local search — simulated annealing / hill-climbing swapping students between groups, keeping only hard-constraint-preserving moves that lower total soft penalty; many random restarts, keep best.
4. Scorecard — report every hard constraint satisfied, each soft metric scored, and any unavoidable violation surfaced with a reason.

## UI model

Auto-solve **plus** manual override. After solving, show a board (one column per group, student chips, tutor(s) at top, live scorecard). Dragging a student re-validates live: hard-rule-breaking moves turn the chip red with a tooltip explaining why; soft scores update instantly. Operator can lock students and re-solve around them. Export writes a per-unit results sheet + appended `History`, plus a printable/PDF roster.

## Build phases (spec §6)

1. Data + validation: template, in-browser parse, input validation/error reporting — prove the load→display→export round-trip first.
2. Solver: hard-constraint engine + greedy seed + local search + scorecard.
3. Interactive board: drag-drop, live re-validation, locking, soft-weight sliders, re-solve.
4. Export polish: write-back with history append, printable roster, PDF.

## Repo hygiene (this repo is PUBLIC)

- The repo is **public** under `UHMed-OME`. No student data may ever be committed; `.gitignore` excludes `*.xlsx`/`*.csv`/`/data/`.
- A version-controlled pre-commit hook in `.githooks/pre-commit` hard-blocks committing any spreadsheet/data file (`.xlsx/.xls/.csv/.numbers/.ods/.tsv`), even with `git add -f`. Only `*.template.xlsx`/`*.template.csv` (de-identified) are allowed.
- **After cloning, activate the hook:** `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (it is not auto-enabled by clone).

## Running / testing

There is no build or test tooling. To run, open the `.html` file directly in a browser (`start file.html` on Windows). When validating the solver, test against a real **de-identified** past unit to confirm it reproduces a sensible assignment — never use real student data in this repo.
